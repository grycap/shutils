0. WHAT IS THIS?

This is a set of shell utils that solve common problems.

E.g.
    - runall - runs a command in multiple hosts
    - scpall - copies a file or a folder to multiple hosts
    - cacheoutput - runs a command and stores its output as a cache (for a limited time) for future runs. It is designed for long-running commands that are ran frequently (e.g. a slow network connection) and may hang a server
    - lockdir - is a folder based lock that is designed to prevent multiple concurrent runs as a semaphore. It can be configured to state how multiple runs are allowed
    - sshblock - is a command to prevent ssh-probe attacks that blacklists those IP addresses that are trying multiple connections (tested in ubuntu-based systems)

1. INSTALL

Most utils are designed to be used as themselves. Only sshblock is designed to act as a resident application

1.1 sshblock
	You should the next line to the file /etc/hosts.deny
		ALL:/etc/sshblock/blacklist
	You must add the next line to the file /etc/hosts.allow
		sshd:ALL EXCEPT /etc/sshblock/blacklist:spawn ( /usr/local/bin/sshblock -w /etc/sshblock/whitelist -l /var/log/auth -m 5 & )
1.2 updateconfig

	If you plan to install updateconfig to update config files, you need to install the cpyutils library. Please follow the instructions at https://github.com/grycap/cpyutils
